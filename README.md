# Introduction
This repository contain code to create an EEGLAB plugin to perform source 
reconstruction of ERPs with Fieldtrip. This plugin was designed in a minimalist 
fashion so it could be used as template for other similar plugins. The 
plugin also contains extensive comments.

# Instaling/cloning
This plugin may be downloaded and placed in the EEGLAB plugin folder.
Alternatively, it may be installed by the EEGLAB plugin manager.

# Versions
It is always good to have a section in the README.md file describing
changes between revisions. We advised to issue a release on Github for each
revision and the link to the zip release can then be copied to this page
https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/plugin_uploader/upload_form.php
so the release appears in the EEGLAB plugin manager.

v1.00 - initial release
